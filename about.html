      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Sanjay Karmur</strong>, and I am a passionate technophile who thrives at the intersection of creativity and technology. From an early age, I developed a fascination for how devices, software, and networks function — and over time, that curiosity evolved into a professional pursuit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</strong>, where I continue to expand my knowledge in programming, databases, networking, and operating systems. Alongside academics, I actively build my portfolio through real-world testing, bug reporting, and small development projects.
      </p>

      <h3>My Expertise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smartphone Testing:</strong> Hands-on experience in identifying usability flaws, system bugs, and performance bottlenecks.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Hunting:</strong> Reported 275+ valid feedbacks and issues that improved software quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Designing and developing clean, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li><strong>Networking & Security:</strong> Deep interest in ethical hacking, system vulnerabilities, and preventive measures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have not only tested pre-release devices but also gained recognition for reporting accurate, impactful feedback that shaped product development. This journey taught me the importance of precision, attention to detail, and persistence — qualities that define my professional approach.
      </p>

      <h3>My Vision</h3>
      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills to achieve financial independence and establish myself as a respected professional in the technology sector. I aim to contribute meaningfully to innovation, whether through software testing, development, or creating digital solutions that solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning, adaptability, and resilience — values that guide me every day. With dedication and effort, I am confident in building a net worth of at least 10 Crores in my lifetime while inspiring others through my journey.
      </p>

      <h3>Beyond Technology</h3>
      <p>
        While technology excites me, I also believe in spirituality, discipline, and balance. Rooted in my Hindu faith yet respectful of all religions, I value integrity, culture, and community. These values influence not just my personal life but also the way I approach professional challenges.
